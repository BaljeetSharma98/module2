Metacrafters in this challenge, I have created MyContract Smart Contract
Overview
The MyContract smart contract is a simple example written in Solidity. It allows users to store and retrieve two values (value1 and value2). The contract includes functions to set and get these values.

Features
Set Value 1: Users can set the value of value1.
Set Value 2: Users can set the value of value2.
Get Value 1: Users can retrieve the value of value1.
Get Value 2: Users can retrieve the value of value2.

I have made a frontend using these files:
index.html,
app.js, 
contract.sol, 
style.css, 
2_deploy_contract.js file
